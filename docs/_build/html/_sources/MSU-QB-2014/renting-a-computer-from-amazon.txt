So, as we've discussed, we're going to be renting computers from Amazon
for the remainder of the course.

Upsides:

1. The Amazon computer will pretty much always work.

2. You'll be in an environment that you completely control.

Downsides:

1. Overhead.  ($$ -- ask your advisor)

2. You have to take control of the environment.

To get started, see :doc:`starting-your-cloud-system`.
