Start up an EC2 instance
========================

Here, we're going to startup an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic
Cloud Computing (EC2) "instance", or computer.

----

Go to 'https://aws.amazon.com' in a Web browser.

Select 'My Account/Console' menu option 'AWS Management Console."

.. Log in with your username & password.
Log in with the following:

- **username: qb2014msu@gmail.com**
- **password: TemporaryQB2014**

Make sure it says North Virginia in the upper right, then select EC2
(upper left).

Select "Launch Instance" (midway down the page).

Next, scroll down the list of operating system types until you find
Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (PV) -- it should be at the very bottom.  Click 'select'.
(See :doc:`starting-up-a-custom-ami` if you want to start up a custom
operating system instead of Ubuntu 14.04.)

Scroll down the list of instance types until you find "m1.xlarge".  Select
the box to the left, and then click "Review and Launch."

Before the launch, we need to name our intances, so we can tell ours from
others'. Click on "5.Tag Instance" at the top of that page.

Add an unique value at the "Value" column, e.g. your name. Then click on
"6.Configure Security Group".

Choose "Select an existing security group", select "for_class" under column "Name" and click "Review and Launch":

Ignore the warning, double check that it says "Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (PV)" at AMI Details, and cick "Launch".

.. The **first** time through, you will have to "create a new key pair", which you must then name (something like 'amazon') and download.

.. After this first time, you will be able to "Choose an existing key pair".
Normally you will need to "create a new key pair" the first time through.
However, for the purpose of easier management of our shared accout,

**Select "Choose an existing key pair" and Select a key pair "QB2014"**.

Then you should see a "pending" line in the menu.

Wait until it turns green, then make a note of the "Public DNS" (we
suggest copying and pasting it into a text notepad somewhere).  This
is your machine name, which you will need for logging in.
