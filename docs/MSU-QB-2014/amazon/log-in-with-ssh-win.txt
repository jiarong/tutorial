Logging into your new instance "in the cloud" (Windows version)
===============================================================

Download .pem file
===================
First we need a private key file to log in; it is the .pem file we already
created during the setup of amazon instance. For convience of managing the
shared account, we want you all to use the same .pem file, which can be
downloaded from:

**http://lyorn.idyll.org/~gjr/public/QB2014/QB2014.pem**

If your browser is firefox with default settings, it should be downloaded into your "Downloads" folder. Move it onto "Desktop".

If your browser is chrome with default settings, the above link will be shown
as a page with text. right click and select "Save As". In the pop up window,
change the directory to "Desktop" and the file name is still "QB2014.pem"

Other browsers should be similar to either of the above two case.

Download Putty and Puttygen from here: http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html

Generate a ppk file from your pem file
======================================

(You only need to do this once!)

Open puttygen; select "Load".

Find and load your '.pem' file; it's probably in your Downloads
folder.  Note, you have to select 'All files' on the bottom.

Now, "save private key".  Put it somewhere easy to find.

by puttygen).  Then select 'Open'.

Log in as "ubuntu".

Declare victory!

   :width: 50%

Here, you're logging in as user 'ubuntu' to the machine
'ec2-174-129-122-189.compute-1.amazonaws.com' using the authentication
key located in 'amazon.pem' on your Desktop.

You should now see a text line that starts with something like
``ubuntu@ip-10-235-34-223:~$``.  You're in!  Now type::

   sudo bash
   cd /root

to switch into superuser mode (see: http://xkcd.com/149/) and go to your
home directory.

This is where the rest of the tutorials will start!

.. If you have Dropbox, you should now visit :doc:`installing-dropbox`.

You might also want to read about :doc:`terminating-your-instance`.

To log out, type::

   exit
   logout

or just close the window.
