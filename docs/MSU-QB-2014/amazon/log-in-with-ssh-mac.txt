Logging into your new instance "in the cloud" (Mac or Linux version)
=====================================================================

OK, so you've created a running computer.  How do you get to it?

The main thing you'll need is the network name of your new computer.
To retrieve this, go to the instance view and click on the instance,
and find the "Public DNS".  This is the public name of your computer
on the Internet.

Copy this name, and connect to that computer with ssh under the username
'ubuntu', as follows:

.. First, find your private key file; it's the .pem file you downloaded when starting up your EC2 instance.  It should be in your Downloads folder. Move it onto your desktop and rename it to 'amazon.pem'.
First we need a private key file to log in; it is the .pem file we already
created during the setup of amazon instance. For convience of managing the
shared account, we want you all to use the same .pem file, which can be
downloaded from:

**http://lyorn.idyll.org/~gjr/public/QB2014/QB2014.pem**

If your browser is firefox with default settings, it should be downloaded into your "Downloads" folder. Move it onto "Desktop".

If your browser is chrome with default settings, the above link will be shown
as a page with text. right click and select "Save As". In the pop up window,
change the directory to "Desktop" and the file name is still "QB2014.pem"

Next, start Terminal:

- in Applications... Utilities... for mac
- use shortcut "CTRL+ATL+T" for linux

and then type::

  chmod og-rwx ~/Desktop/QB2014.pem
..  chmod og-rwx ~/Desktop/amazon.pem

to set the permissions on the private key file to "closed to all evildoers".

Then type::

  ssh -i ~/Desktop/QB2014.pem ubuntu@ec2-???-???-???-???.compute-1.amazonaws.com
..  ssh -i ~/Desktop/amazon.pem ubuntu@ec2-???-???-???-???.compute-1.amazonaws.com

(but you have to replace the stuff after the '@' sign with the name of the host).

Here, you're logging in as user 'ubuntu' to the machine
'ec2-174-129-122-189.compute-1.amazonaws.com' using the authentication
key located in 'QB2014.pem' on your Desktop.

You should now see a text line that starts with something like
``ubuntu@ip-10-235-34-223:~$``.  You're in!  Now type::

   sudo bash
   cd /root

to switch into superuser mode (see: http://xkcd.com/149/) and go to your
home directory.

This is where the rest of the tutorials will start!

.. If you have Dropbox, you should now visit :doc:`installing-dropbox`.

You might also want to read about :doc:`terminating-your-instance`.

To log out, type::

   exit
   logout

or just close the window.
