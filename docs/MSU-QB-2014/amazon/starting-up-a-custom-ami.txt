Starting up a custom operating system
=====================================

The instructions in :doc:`start-up-an-ec2-instance` tell you how to
start up a machine with Ubuntu Linux version 14.04 on it, but that
machine comes with very little software installed. For anything
where you are executing actual analyses, you're going to want to have
a bunch of basic software installed.

Therefore, we make custom versions of Ubuntu available as well, that
come with some software pre-installed.

To boot these, go to EC2/Launch and select "Community AMIs" instead of
the default "Quick Start"; 

Then type in the AMI number or name given to you in the tutorial.  The AMI in the below screenshot is **NOT the right one**. We need to use:
|
|
| **ami-d25283ba**
|
|
for this whole workship. Or you can just type "MSU" in the search box and hit
ENTER. **"MSU 2014 QB Summer Course"** is the one needed.

Then proceed with the rest of
:doc:`start-up-an-ec2-instance`.
